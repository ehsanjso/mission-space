## Story

### Why not the main project?

I wanted to answer to the task initially, but I use a macbook and it was not possible (at least easily) to run the simulator. I actually got a VM from digital ocean and ran the simulator. Got the code running and reading the values through UDP. Then I decided to make it more of a frontend challenge instead of backend.

### Why this new implementation?

I think space needs solutions relevant to space. Therefore, it seemed natural to use 3D web as a nice medium to handle the information. Assuming that we read the values from the simulator, the application visualizes the spaceship position relative to moon surface.

Considering that we have this 3D view gives us a vast opportunity to integrate more sensor data and visualize the surroundings, on top of just visualizing the spaceship position.

If I want to wrap up the implemented application in a sentence it would be tesla visualization for mission control.
